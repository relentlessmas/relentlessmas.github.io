// Add breakpoint settings.

// Breakpoint allows us to embed media queries directly into each rule that
// needs it, rather than forcing a developer to place rules for a single
// component in multiple places depending on the media query they want to
// affect.

// @see https://github.com/Team-Sass/breakpoint/wiki
//
// Listed here are named breakpoints. They can vary in complexity, allowing you to
// get rid of the cognitive load behind typing and remembering media queries.
